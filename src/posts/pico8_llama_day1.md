When I first launched up PICO-8 I had wanted to make a bunny game. I have a pet rabbit called Zeus who is a 'ruby eye white'. It turns out though that I can't draw rabbits, so I figured my sprite decided it was a llama and I'm now making a llama game.

After I drew my sprite I drew a basic background, and added in some daisies to the background, maybe eventually the llama will eat them or something similar to increase health?
