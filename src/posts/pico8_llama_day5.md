Only had a little bit of time today, wanted to spend some hours on another project. Today I started with putting enemies on the map and moving around, then adding some interactions. I started with foxes which I do want to move randomly, and cause damage to the llama if they collide. I found some code on [/r/pico8](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/vgo9o4/help_i_created_enemies_and_added_random_movement/) for random enemy movement, I thought it would be a good place to start, so I got it working then made some changes/adaptations for my own code.
