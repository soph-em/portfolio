I started this game as a side project. My main focus up till now has been web dev, but PICO-8 was one of the first ways of coding that I fell in love with.

Over two years ago now, I was introduced to PICO-8 and made a little 'space raiders' game. It's so basic but you know those projects that you keep on your portfolio just out of sentimentality? I didn't know how to code at the time, so I struggled through it with a lot of help. I came back to PICO-8 because I wanted something fun and lighthearted while I refocus on what my next projects are.

I've never really been a blogger, so this is very new to me! I'm really enjoying sharing my progress on Twitter, but there's so much more I can share without the character limit!

I hope you enjoy reading more about my Llama game journey!
